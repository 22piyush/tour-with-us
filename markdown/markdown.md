Temples are considered one of the most important places in Hinduism. They are seen as a sacred place where Hindus can go to worship and connect with their gods. Temples hold an important place in one’s mind and are often seen as a symbol of hope. For many Hindus, a temple is a place of refuge during difficult times.

In history, there have been many famous temples that have been built. 

**Why are Temples Important?**

Temples are very important for one’s personal growth and development. They are a place where we can go to receive guidance from our Heavenly Father, learn more about His plan for us, and make covenants with Him. In the temple, we also receive power through priesthood ordinances that enable us to overcome challenges in our lives and return to live with Him someday.
